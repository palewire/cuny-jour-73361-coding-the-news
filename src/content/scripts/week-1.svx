### Create a code folder

Open **Finder** (Mac) or **File Explorer** (Windows)

Navigate to your home folder:
- **Mac:** Click your username in the sidebar, or press `Cmd + Shift + H`
- **Windows:** Click "This PC" then your user folder

Create a new folder called `code`
   - **Mac:** `Cmd + Shift + N` → type `code` → press Enter
   - **Windows:** Right-click → New → Folder → type `code` → press Enter

> **Tell students:** "This `code` folder is where all your projects will live this semester. Keep it tidy."

### Open a folder as a project

1. In VS Code, go to **File → Open Folder** (or `Cmd + O` on Mac / `Ctrl + K, Ctrl + O` on Windows)

2. Navigate to your new `code` folder

3. Click **Open** (Mac) or **Select Folder** (Windows)

4. Look at the left sidebar—it should say `CODE` at the top with nothing inside yet

> **Explain:** "In VS Code, we always work inside folders, not individual files. This folder is your 'project.' Everything related to one project lives together."

### Create a README.md file

1. In the left sidebar, hover over the word `CODE`

2. Click the **New File** icon (looks like a page with a plus sign)

3. Type `README.md` and press Enter

4. The file opens in the editor. Type this:

```markdown
# My First Project

Live from New York, this is my first README file.

## About Me

I'm learning to code at CUNY.
```

5. Save the file: `Cmd + S` (Mac) or `Ctrl + S` (Windows)

### Step 5: Learn a little Markdown

**Explain while typing in the file:**

1. Add a blank line, then type:
```markdown
## What I'm Learning

- VS Code
- GitHub
- Svelte
```

2. Show them the **Preview**:
   - Right-click the tab → **Open Preview**
   - Or click the preview icon in the top-right (looks like a split window with magnifying glass)

3. Demonstrate more Markdown:
```markdown
## Formatting Examples

This is **bold text** and this is *italic text*.

Here's a [link to GitHub](https://github.com).

> This is a blockquote. Use it for notes or quotes.
```

4. Save again with `Cmd + S` / `Ctrl + S`

> **Pause here.** Walk around (or check screens) to make sure everyone has their README.md looking correct.

## Part 2: Introduction to GitHub

### Step 6: Sign in to GitHub from VS Code

Before we can publish our code, we need to connect VS Code to your GitHub account.

1. Look at the bottom-left corner of VS Code for the **Accounts** icon (looks like a person silhouette)

2. Click the **Accounts** icon

3. Click **Sign in with GitHub to use GitHub Copilot**
   - If you see multiple options, choose any GitHub sign-in option

4. A browser window will open asking you to authorize VS Code

5. Click **Authorize Visual-Studio-Code**

6. You may be asked to enter your GitHub password or confirm with two-factor authentication

7. When you see "You can close this tab," return to VS Code

8. Back in VS Code, the Accounts icon should now show your GitHub profile picture or a checkmark

> **Important:** If you don't have a GitHub account yet:
> - Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and click **Sign up**
> - Use your CUNY email or personal email
> - Choose a professional username (you'll use this publicly)
> - Then return here and sign in from VS Code

### Step 7: Open the Source Control sidebar

1. Look at the left sidebar in VS Code for the **Source Control** icon (looks like a branch with dots, or a Y shape)
   - You can also press `Ctrl + Shift + G` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + G` (Mac)

2. Click the Source Control icon

3. You'll see a message that says **"No source control providers registered"** or **"Open a folder that contains a repository"** — that's okay!

4. Click the **Initialize Repository** button

5. VS Code now shows your `README.md` file under **"Changes"** with a **U** next to it (U means "untracked" — Git sees it but isn't tracking it yet)

> **Explain:** "Source Control is where we track changes to our files and share them with GitHub. The sidebar shows us which files have changed."

### Step 8: Commit your first change

A **commit** is like a snapshot of your project at a specific moment. Let's create our first commit.

1. In the Source Control sidebar, hover over the word **"Changes"**

2. Click the **+** icon that appears (this "stages" all your changes)
   - Your file moves from "Changes" to "Staged Changes"
   - The letter changes from **U** to **A** (A means "added")

3. At the top of the Source Control sidebar, find the **Message** text box

4. Type a commit message: `Add my first README`

5. Click the **Commit** button (the checkmark icon) or press `Cmd + Enter` (Mac) / `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows)

> **Explain:** "A commit message describes what you changed. Write it like a headline — short and clear. Future you will thank present you for good commit messages."

### Step 9: Publish to GitHub

Now let's put this project on GitHub so the world can see it!

1. After committing, the **Commit** button changes to say **Publish Branch**

2. Click **Publish Branch**

3. VS Code asks what to name your repository:
   - The default name will be your folder name (`code`)
   - Change it to something more descriptive like `my-first-repo`

4. Choose **Publish to GitHub Public repository**
   - Public means anyone can see your code (this is normal for learning!)
   - You can also choose Private if you prefer

5. VS Code creates the repository on GitHub and pushes your code automatically!

6. You may see a notification saying **"Would you like to open the repository on GitHub?"** — click **Open on GitHub**

> **Celebrate!** "You just published code to the internet. This is how professionals share and collaborate on code."

### Step 10: See your repository on GitHub

1. If you didn't click the notification, open your browser and go to [github.com](https://github.com)

2. Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner

3. Click **Your repositories**

4. Click on **my-first-repo** (or whatever you named it)

5. You should see your `README.md` file displayed beautifully!

> **Point out:** "GitHub automatically renders your Markdown file. The `# My First Project` became a big heading, and your bullet points became a nice list."

### Step 11: Make a change and sync again

Let's practice the workflow of editing, committing, and syncing.

1. Back in VS Code, click on your `README.md` file to open it

2. Add a new section at the bottom:

```markdown
## Today's Date

I created this repository on January 26, 2026.
```

3. Save the file: `Cmd + S` (Mac) / `Ctrl + S` (Windows)

4. Look at the Source Control sidebar — your file now shows with an **M** (M means "modified")

5. **Review the changes before committing:**
   - Click on `README.md` in the Source Control sidebar
   - VS Code opens a "diff view" showing what you changed
   - Red/pink background = old content (removed)
   - Green background = new content (added)

6. Click the **+** icon next to `README.md` to stage the change

7. Type a commit message: `Add today's date`

8. Click **Commit**

9. The button now says **Sync Changes** — click it to push your changes to GitHub

10. Go to GitHub in your browser and refresh the page — you'll see the update!

> **Key concept:** "The workflow is: Edit → Save → Stage → Commit → Sync. You'll do this hundreds of times."

### Step 12: View your commit history

1. On GitHub, look for a link that says **"2 commits"** (or similar) near the top of the file list

2. Click it to see your **commit history**

3. Click on your most recent commit message (**"Add today's date"**)

4. **Explain the diff view:**
   - Red lines (with `-`) = content that was removed
   - Green lines (with `+`) = content that was added
   - This is how you track every change over time

5. Back in VS Code, you can also see history:
   - Right-click on your `README.md` file
   - Click **Open Timeline**
   - The Timeline panel shows all your commits for this file

> **Key concept:** "Every change you make is recorded forever. You can always go back to any previous version. This is called version control."

## Part 3: Introduction to GitHub Copilot

### Step 14: Set up GitHub for Students

1. Go to:
   ```
   https://education.github.com/pack
   ```

2. Click **Get your pack** or **Sign up for Student Developer Pack**

3. Verify your student status:
   - Use your `.cuny.edu` email
   - You may need to upload proof of enrollment (ID card, enrollment letter)
   - Approval can take a few hours to a few days

> **If not approved yet:** Students can still follow along and try Copilot with the free tier, or watch your demo.

### Step 15: Install GitHub Copilot extension

1. In VS Code, click the **Extensions** icon in the left sidebar (looks like four squares)

2. Search for `GitHub Copilot`

3. Install **GitHub Copilot** (the main one by GitHub)

4. Also install **GitHub Copilot Chat**

5. **Sign in to GitHub:**
   - A popup should appear asking you to sign in
   - Click **Sign in to GitHub**
   - Authorize in the browser
   - Return to VS Code

6. Look for the Copilot icon in the bottom-right status bar (looks like a two-blade propeller). It should show a checkmark when active.

### Step 16: Open the Copilot Chat panel

1. Click the **Chat icon** in the left sidebar (speech bubble icon)
   - Or use `Cmd + Shift + I` (Mac) / `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Windows)

2. The Copilot Chat panel opens on the right side

3. **Try a simple chat:**
   Type: `What is a README file?`
   Press Enter

4. Copilot will explain. This is your AI coding assistant!

### Step 17: Experiment with chatting

**Have students try these prompts:**

1. `What is Markdown?`

2. `How do I make a numbered list in Markdown?`

3. `Write me a short bio for a journalism student`

### Step 18: Demonstrate "Ask" mode (planning)

1. In the chat, type:
   ```
   How should I structure a portfolio website for a journalist?
   ```

2. Copilot gives you a plan—it doesn't write code yet, just advises

### Step 19: Demonstrate "Edit" mode

1. Open your `README.md` file

2. Select all the text (`Cmd + A` / `Ctrl + A`)

3. Press `Cmd + I` (Mac) / `Ctrl + I` (Windows) to open inline Copilot

4. Type: `Add a section about my favorite news websites with three bullet points`

5. Press Enter. Copilot will suggest changes inline.

6. Click **Accept** to apply the changes

### Step 20: Have Copilot write the commit message

1. Click the **Source Control** icon in the left sidebar (looks like a branch/fork)

2. You'll see your changed file listed

3. In the **Message** box at the top, click the **sparkle icon** (✨) next to the text field
   - Or right-click and choose "Generate Commit Message with Copilot"

4. Copilot suggests a commit message based on your changes

5. If it looks good, click the **checkmark** to accept

6. Click **Commit** then **Push** (or **Sync Changes**)

## Part 4: Clone an Existing Repository

### Step 21: Find a news organization's GitHub page

1. Open your browser and go to one of these:
   ```
   https://github.com/nytimes
   https://github.com/washingtonpost
   https://github.com/latimes-datadesk
   https://github.com/reuters-graphics
   https://github.com/fivethirtyeight
   ```

2. Browse their repositories. Look for ones with good README files.

3. **For this demo, let's use:**
   ```
   https://github.com/datadesk/baker-example-page-template
   ```
   *(or choose another simple one)*

### Step 22: Clone the repository

1. On the GitHub repository page, click the green **Code** button

2. Copy the HTTPS URL (click the clipboard icon)

3. In VS Code, press `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac) / `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows) to open the Command Palette

4. Type `Git: Clone` and select it

5. Paste the URL you copied

6. Choose a location (your `code` folder or a subfolder)

7. Click **Open** when asked to open the cloned repository

### Step 23: Ask Copilot to explain the project

1. Open the Copilot Chat panel

2. Type:
   ```
   @workspace Explain what this project does and how it's structured
   ```

3. Copilot analyzes the files and gives you an overview

> **Explain:** "The `@workspace` tag tells Copilot to look at all the files in your project, not just the one you have open."

### Step 24: Ask Copilot how to install it

1. In the chat, type:
   ```
   @workspace How do I install and run this project?
   ```

2. Copilot reads the README and gives you step-by-step instructions

3. Follow those steps in your terminal!

**Common steps might include:**
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

> **Note:** Some projects may fail to install due to missing dependencies. That's okay! The point is learning the process.

### Step 25: Troubleshoot with Copilot

If you hit an error:

1. Copy the error message

2. Paste it into Copilot Chat:
   ```
   I got this error: [paste error here]. How do I fix it?
   ```

3. Follow Copilot's suggestions

> **Key lesson:** "Errors are normal. The skill is learning to read them and fix them—Copilot helps with that."

## Homework Assignments

**Read this aloud and display on screen:**

### Part 1: Repository Practice
Create **five different repositories** on GitHub, each with a simple README.md file. Ideas:
- A repository about yourself
- A repository about your favorite topic for reporting
- A repository listing tools you want to learn
- A repository with notes from another class
- A repository with a recipe or how-to guide

### Part 2: News Organization Exploration
Find and clone **three repositories**:
- Two from **news organizations** (NYT, WaPo, LA Times, Reuters, etc.)
- One from a **non-news tech company** (Google, Microsoft, Meta, etc.)

For each:
1. Use VS Code to clone it
2. Ask Copilot to explain what it does
3. Try to install and run it (it's okay if it fails!)

### Part 3: Write a Report
Write a **one-page report** (in a README.md file!) that includes:
- A couple paragraphs about each repository you explored
- What worked, what didn't, what you learned
- Which repository was most interesting and why

### Part 4: Prepare to Present
Pick your **most interesting repository** from Part 2. Be ready to share your screen for 2-3 minutes and tell the class:
- What the project does
- What you found interesting about it
- One thing you learned from exploring it
